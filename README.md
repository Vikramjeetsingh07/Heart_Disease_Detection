# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

Heart disease prevention is more critical than ever. Data-driven systems that predict heart diseases can significantly enhance research and prevention efforts, ensuring that more individuals lead healthier lives. This project leverages machine learning to predict heart diseases with a high degree of accuracy.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze heart disease patient data, perform thorough data processing, and train various machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease. The models utilized include KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.

## Project Description

This project utilizes a heart disease dataset for binary classification, where the objective is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on various input parameters. The target variable is binary, indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.
